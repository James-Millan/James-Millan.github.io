            <p>During the covid-19 lockdowns of 2020-2021 I did barely any rigorous exercise. After falling ill with the
                virus in the middle of May 2021 I decided that it was time for a change. After recovering, I had fallen to about
                70kg in weight which is quite low for my height. So my focus was on building strength and hence muscle.</p>

            <p>At the start I tried learning as many different movements as possible. Before arriving at a routine that
            I do weekly that works for me. For the best results I believe it is optimal to perform the same movements
            over and over increasing the overall number: <b>sets</b> x <b>reps</b> x <b>weight</b> each week. Currently,
            below is the 4-day split I do each week. I run mesocycles in which each mesocycle is 3 weeks. Week 1 is
            strength week, 85% of 1rm for 3 reps and 120 seconds rest for all movements. Week 2 is hypertrophy week and
            is 75% of 1rm for 6 reps and 75 seconds rest for all movements. Week 3 is endurance week and is 65% of 1rm
            12 reps. You then either test or repeat a cycle at a slightly higher hypothetical 1rm (usually +2.5kg).</p>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Your Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories you burn each day just by existing. Calculate this
                <a href="/BMRCalc.html">here.</a>
                In order to gain muscle: Try and be in a 200-300 caloric surplus each day. This includes your BMR + any amount
                of calories that you burn of exercising in the day. A good rule of thumb is "you shouldn't feel hungry during
                the day when trying to gain muscle". Aim to eat high protein meals. This is optimal for muscle recovery, and
                protein is the best at satiating you because when you eat protein, the hormone Leptin is released which inhibits
                hunger. Similarly, you burn 20-30% of calories in protein through digestion.
                It is for this reason that a high protein diet is also great if you are trying to lose weight. As well as strength
                training 3 times a week, try and hit 10,000 steps every day. If you can maintain a 500 calorie deficit,
                then that's 3500 calories lost per week. This equates to losing 1 pound of body fat per week.
